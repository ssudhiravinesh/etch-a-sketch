# etch-a-sketch

This is part of THEODINPROJECT projects. 
Etch-a-sktech is like a grid slate where you can sketch by hovering your mouse over the given grid. 
You can also set the resolution using the customisable options. 
This uses DOM, Flexbox (and not CSS Grid), and basic HTML. 
Hope you like the project. These are just baby steps. 
This project is open to suggestions!
